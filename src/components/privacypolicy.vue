<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How we use your information<br>
</strong>Our business is to provide you with education and training services, as well as other related services and products. In order to do that effectively, we use your information for a range of different purposes, including:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">• to verify your identity<br>

<p style="text-align: left;">We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Organisations we disclose to<br>
</strong>Sometimes, we disclose your information to our related entities or individuals or organisations outside GPEx. Common situations in which we disclose your information include:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">• sharing your information with training service providers who deliver GPEx’s training solutions<br>
• sharing your information with other organisations as directed by you (for example, in connection with employment applications)<br>
• disclosing your information to our contractors and other service providers (for example, in connection with external clinical placements, data management contractors, and marketing and promotional contractors)<br>
• where we are legally authorised or required to do so (including disclosing information to courts, tribunals, dispute resolution bodies, or law enforcement and national security agencies)<br>
• if we believe the disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to the life, health or safety of any individual, or to public health or safety</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Do we send your information overseas?<br>
</strong>In some cases, we may disclose your information to organisations, such as our providers of cloud services and website hosting services. These organisations may be based, or have servers, outside Australia. We will only disclose your personal information in compliance with the Privacy Act and APPs and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that those organisations protect and keep confidential the information they receive from us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Can you request to deal with us without identifying yourself?<br>
</strong>We understand that anonymity is an important element of privacy. In most cases, we need to know who you are in order to process and/or manage your application, enquiry, training or request. You can request to deal with us anonymously or by using a pseudonym in relation to certain matters; for example, when making a complaint unless we need to know your identity in order to investigate the complaint (such as in relation to a particular service provided by a training service provider). If it is practicable to deal with us anonymously or under a pseudonym, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information that you provide to us anonymously or under a pseudonym is not able to be linked with other information that we may have about you. If you wish to deal with us anonymously or under a pseudonym, please contact the GPEx Privacy Officer using the contact details below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How to access your personal (or business) information<br>
</strong>We will provide you with access to personal (or business) information about you which is held by us, subject to the exceptions in the Privacy Act (for example, we may refuse to give you access to your personal information if giving access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other people, or if your request for access is frivolous or vexatious).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before giving you access to any information, we will require you to verify your identity in a manner that is reasonable in the circumstances and also to specify the information you wish to access. If we refuse to give you access to your information, we will provide you with reasons for our refusal. For example, if we are not satisfied as to the identity of the requester.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You will not be charged for lodging a request to access your personal (or business) information. Requests for access to information should, in the first instance, be directed to GPEx reception (at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:reception@gpex.com.au">reception@gpex.com.au</a>&nbsp;or by calling 08 8490 0400) who will refer the request to an appropriate person within GPEx.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How to update your personal (or business) information<br>
</strong>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal (or business) information about you which is held by us is accurate, up to date, complete and relevant.<br>
We encourage you to contact us as soon as possible in order to update any information we hold about you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If we update or amend personal (or business) information about you that we previously disclosed to another entity, and you request that we notify that entity, we will take reasonable steps to give that notification.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If we refuse to update your information, we will provide you with the reasons for our refusal. If you ask us to, we will associate the relevant information with a statement that you have advised that the information is inaccurate or out of date.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How we keep your personal (or business) information secure<br>
</strong>GPEx uses several physical and electronic security measures to protect personal (or business) information from misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. For example, we restrict physical access to our offices, and we use a combination of security containers, firewalls, secure databases, computer user identifiers and passwords to protect personal information held by us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Emails you send to us are screened by our email security systems and may be viewed by authorised GPEx information technology personnel and service providers for security purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All personal information collected and stored by GPEx is held for a specified period of time, prior to eventual destruction. Time requirements for retention of personal information may be statutory in nature or, required under contract, or necessary for procedural fairness as determined by GPEx. We maintain an active Retention and Destruction schedule setting out retention times for personal and other information. GPEx regularly considers and reviews information collected to ensure that we do not collect excessive or irrelevant personal information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Any data breaches will be treated in the manner set out in the GPEx Data Breach Response Plan to contain and reduce the risk of unauthorised access, disclosure or loss of personal information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Subject to applicable laws and our internal policies, we take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify personal (or business) information about you when we no longer need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How you can make a privacy complaint<br>
</strong>If you have a concern about the way in which GPEx handles your personal information and wish to make a complaint, please contact GPEx’s Privacy Officer (using the contact details below). We are committed to acknowledging your complaint in a prompt manner and will give you an estimated timeframe for when we will respond to your complaint.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is our intention to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction. However, if you do not believe that the matter has been resolved satisfactorily, you are entitled to contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner on 1300 363 992 (local call charges apply) or by using the other contact details on the <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au">Commissioner’s website</a>.
